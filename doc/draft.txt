Lack of automatic currying provides benefits like:
- optional arguments with default values
- variadic arguments: you can have a single function zip, rather than zip, zip2, zip3, ...
- if you pass too few parameters to a function, it is nicely pinpointed as an error right there rather than producing a functional value.
Manual currying can be reasonably slick with a few macros, like TXR Lisp's op, ap and ret, plus various combinators. Thanks to the unambiguous syntax, it remains readable.
Manual currying can be more fully featured compared to automatic. You can insert the arguments anywhere in any order. Implicit currying only handles the rightmost args.
